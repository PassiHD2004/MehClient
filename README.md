# MehClient (Discontinued)
A Fabric (and Quilt) Mod that changes the look of the Minecraft UI and adds some features.

## Features
TODO: add a list of features

## FAQ
### Can I use this on a Vanilla server?
Yeah sure. MehClient is 100% client side and doesn't require anything to be installed on the server.

### Is there gonna be a forge version?
NO [here's why](https://v.foxes4life.net/trol.png)


#### This is a Fork of FoxClient
Please respect the original Creators: https://github.com/FoxStudios/FoxClient

## Why is it discontinued?
I decided to work on the official Client instead, so this one wont get updated anymore. And its way harder maintaining a fork as i thought.
